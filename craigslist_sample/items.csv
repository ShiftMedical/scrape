What opportunities are there?

While you will certainly be trained in all aspects of aesthetic medicine, and will be fluent in the treatments available, you also will learn unique ways to target a service approach to different personality types. And of course, you will be an integral member of a wayward, proactive team which respects your individuality and creativity within the team.
